poupinou master project - tretris game

================
PMP, standing for Poupinou Master Project, is the name of the project i've decided to achive for my project managing class.
We are going to try and create a new Tetris game, where cute sheep (poupinous actually) will replace the usual Tetris bricks. Made of modelling clay, with square bodies and head (to make it easier to code afterwards), they'll have different postures in order to simulate the different tretris shapes. 
Using the stop-motion animation technique, we'll include the images created from pictures to our code file.
The purpose, apart from achieving a funky crazy cool game, is to follow a global project managing plan, using techniques and tools introduced during the class.
We are planning to finish this project by the end of january.

Now, let's have some fun ! 
Poupi poweeeer ina action, yo !
